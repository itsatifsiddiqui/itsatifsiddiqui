        &ldquo;Ask me a Question&rdquo; is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.
        For
        that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
        any
        reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what
        you&rsquo;re paying for.</p>

        The app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service.
        It&rsquo;s
        your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
        jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by
        the
        official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
        programs,
        compromise your phone&rsquo;s security features and it could mean that the app won&rsquo;t work properly or at
        all.

        The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</p>

        You should be aware that there are certain things that &ldquo;Ask me a Question&rdquo; will not take
        responsibility
        for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can
        be
        Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but &ldquo;Ask me a Question&rdquo; cannot take
        responsibility
        for the app not working at full functionality if you don&rsquo;t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don&rsquo;t have
        any
        of your data allowance left.</p>
    <p
        style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>
        If you&rsquo;re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
        agreement
        with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for
        the
        cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using
        the
        app, you&rsquo;re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the
        app
        outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
        bill
        payer for the device on which you&rsquo;re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received
        permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>

        Along the same lines, &ldquo;Ask me a Question&rdquo; cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the
        app
        i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged &ndash; if it runs out of battery and you can&rsquo;t
        turn
        it on to avail the Service, &ldquo;Ask me a Question&rdquo; cannot accept responsibility.</p>
    <p
        style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>
        With respect to &ldquo;Ask me a Question&rdquo;&rsquo; responsibility for your use of the app, when you&rsquo;re
        using the app, it&rsquo;s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and
        correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available
        to
        you. &ldquo;Ask me a Question&rdquo; accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a
        result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
    <p
        style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &amp; iOS &ndash; the
        requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
        to)
        may change, and you&rsquo;ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. &ldquo;Ask me a
        Question&rdquo; does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works
        with
        the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
        updates
        to the application when offered to you, we may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it
        at
        any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a)
        the
        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
        delete
        it from your device.</p>

        <span style="color:black;"><br> <strong>These Terms are effective as of January 1, 2023. We may update these
